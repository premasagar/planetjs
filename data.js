We recently helped them to explore a new web strategy, as part of a prototyping session at Google London, which was <span id=\"more-2092\"></span>organised by <a href=\"http://rewiredstate.org\">Rewired State</a>.</p>\n<h3>First steps on the Web, thanks to an SMS text message</h3>\n<p>People seek out a UK online centre for a number of reasons: to get help emailing their children who are overseas, to fill in a job application that&#8217;s available only on the Web, or to join Facebook because their grandchildren are all on there.</p>\n<p>But there&#8217;s an interesting fact: <em>around 70% of these first-timers have a mobile phone</em>. What if we could take advantage of that fact to make it easier for them to get the help they need?</p>\n<p>I worked with <a href=\"http://twitter.com/symroe\">Sym Roe</a>, <a href=\"http://tomhume.org\">Tom Hume</a> and <a href=\"http://danieljohnmorris.co.uk\">Daniel Morris</a> on a prototype to explore this question. In just a few hours, we had created an SMS text message service, which allows people to text their postcode to a short phone number, and be texted back details of their nearest UK Online centre.</p>\n<h3>How it could work</h3>\n<p>Imagine that you&#8217;re out and about. You see a poster on the wall at a community centre, a library or some other noticeboard, and it says:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Want to get online? To find your nearest UK online centre, send a text message to 82958 saying &#8216;ukonline&#8217; plus your postcode &#8211; e.g. &#8216;ukonline SW1A 2AA&#8217;.</p>\n<p>We’ll text you back with your nearest centre. This service costs 25p.</p></blockquote>\n<p>You can try it out with your own postcode. Did you realise that there&#8217;s a centre so close to you?</p>\n<h3>Ingredients of an SMS web service</h3>\n<p>We took advantage of the really easy-to-use SMS service, <a href=\"http://taykt.com\">Taykt</a> (it&#8217;s pronounced &#8220;take it&#8221;), a new startup based in Brighton. It takes the pain out of dealing with mobile networks and registering shortcode phone numbers.</p>\n<p>First, we chose a keyword for users to start their SMS message with &#8211; in our case, we chose &#8220;<em>ukonline</em>&#8220;. Taykt then passes through to our web service any message that starts with that keyword. If no postcode is supplied, then we just give a generic response. If there is a postcode, then we convert it to a latitude and longitude, then query the UK Online database to find the nearest centre.</p>\n<p>To make best use of the 160 characters available in our text message response, the information we send back is prioritised: first the centre&#8217;s name and phone number is given, and then if there&#8217;s still room in the message, we give the address, and then information about creche facilities, disabled access, etc. We try keep it concise, but human-friendly. Tom wrote about his work on maximising the text message response <a href=\"http://www.tomhume.org/2010/08/rewired-state-hack-day.html\">on his blog</a>.</p>\n<p>Because Takyt lets us pass on the cost of the service to the end user (25p per request), it means it would be a viable proposition for UK Online to get up and running quickly, with little risk or upfront fees.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to check out the code, see Sym&#8217;s <a href=\"http://github.com/symroe/UK-Online-Centres-API\">Django-based web service</a>, and Chris Thorpe&#8217;s <a href=\"http://github.com/jaggeree/ukonline-data\">UK Online API</a>.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a write-up of our SMS Centre Finder project <a href=\"http://rewiredstate.org/projects/sms-centre-finder\">on the Rewired State website</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/dharmafly?a=eigzf04f4oE:8zrEElHM-2w:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/dharmafly?i=eigzf04f4oE:8zrEElHM-2w:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/dharmafly?a=eigzf04f4oE:8zrEElHM-2w:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/dharmafly?i=eigzf04f4oE:8zrEElHM-2w:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/dharmafly?a=eigzf04f4oE:8zrEElHM-2w:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/dharmafly?i=eigzf04f4oE:8zrEElHM-2w:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/dharmafly?a=eigzf04f4oE:8zrEElHM-2w:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/dharmafly?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/dharmafly?a=eigzf04f4oE:8zrEElHM-2w:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/dharmafly?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>"},"summary":{"type":"html","content":"URL: rewiredstate.org/projects/sms-centre-finder There are 61 million people in the UK and 10 million of them have never used the Web.

Ultimately though, I decided to help with an idea by <a href=\"http://openobjects.blogspot.com\">Mia Ridge</a> of the <a href=\"http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk\">Science Museum</a>, for investigating the influences between scientists and their inventions.</p>\n<h3>The evolution of ideas</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/toptechwriter/338573258/\" title=\"Space Shuttle Discovery approaches ISS for docking [1680x1050] by TopTechWriter.US, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/125/338573258_6576d11c64_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"150\" alt=\"Space Shuttle Discovery approaches ISS for docking [1680x1050]\"></a></p>\n<p>Mia wanted to expose some of the rich data about <a href=\"http://collectionsonline.nmsi.ac.uk\">the Museum&#8217;s collections</a> and to demonstrate how scientific ideas and inventions have evolved over time, as each successive generation absorbs the lessons of those who have come before.</p>\n<p>An invention (such as the space shuttle or the mobile phone) doesn&#8217;t simply arrive on the scene all by itself. It will have been the result of countless generations of convergent technologies, research and new paradigms of thinking. So what&#8217;s the thread that connects them together? And how have inventors and thinkers inspired one another and built on each other&#8217;s works?</p>\n<h3>There&#8217;s an app for that</h3>\n<p>A group of us built an explorer, called &#8220;<a href=\"http://dharmafly.com/revolutionaries/\">The Revolutionaries</a>&#8220;. It lets you start with a scientist, say, <a href=\"http://dharmafly.com/revolutionaries/#Isaac_Newton\">Isaac Newton</a>, and then click through to view those who influenced him and those he went on to influence. In fact, because of the way the app is built, it isn&#8217;t just scientists who are matched &#8211; <a href=\"http://dharmafly.com/revolutionaries/#George_Orwell\">writers</a>, <a href=\"http://dharmafly.com/revolutionaries/#Bob_Dylan\">musicians</a> and <a href=\"http://dharmafly.com/revolutionaries/#Prabhat_Ranjan_Sarkar\">thinkers</a> are in there too.</p>\n<h3>Some interesting technologies</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dharmasphere/125136124/\" title=\"The New Species by premasagar, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/45/125136124_c9b11b68c4_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"148\" alt=\"The New Species\"></a></p>\n<p>Hack days are ripe opportunities to experiment with new techniques and technologies. Here are some of those that make up the app:</p>\n<h4>Pulling data out of Wikipedia, with DBpedia</h4>\n<p>When the app first loads, it doesn&#8217;t contain any data at all. To piece together information about a person, it gathers content from the crowd-sourced encyclopaedia, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org\">Wikipedia</a>. We use a service called <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org\">DBpedia</a>, which weaves together Wikipedia articles in a multitude of ways. This allows us to pull data out of Wikipedia as if it were a giant database, using a language called SPARQL.</p>\n<p>We gather information about individuals, and about the connections between them, in order to find out who has influenced who. We then wrap up these requests to DBpedia with the ever-useful web service, <a href=\"http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/\">YQL</a>, which lets us pull the data straight into the application.</p>\n<h4>Using &#8216;localStorage&#8217;, a mini database inside the browser</h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/doommeer/2340829271/\" title=\"autostadt-turm von innen by doommeer, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3294/2340829271_d7d55ebb52_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"234\" alt=\"autostadt-turm von innen\"></a></p>\n<p>Since we are pulling in content from remote web services, we wanted to reduce the number of remote calls that it has to make, and to speed up browsing. So, we use a feature found in all modern browsers, called &#8216;<a href=\"http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/06/localstorage/\">localStorage</a>&#8216; (it&#8217;s part of the <a href=\"http://diveintohtml5.org/introduction.html\">HTML5 suite of tools</a>). This is a small, simple type of database contained with the browser, where we store all the gathered information. It makes navigating through previously viewed content lightning fast, even when browsing on a mobile phone.</p>\n<h4>Micro-templating</h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/hinkelstone/2435823037/\" title=\"labyrinthine circuit board lines by quapan, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2093/2435823037_2f67cc65b1_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"175\" alt=\"labyrinthine circuit board lines\"></a></p>\n<p>The content that the user sees is built up from a small number of tiny pieces of HTML. When new data is loaded, the relevant pieces are assembled and the data is displayed. You can see these simple &#8216;micro-templates&#8217; <a href=\"http://github.com/premasagar/revolutionaries/blob/b19d94e68d4b68e85328696618c92ca29f81d362/index.html#L107\">here, in the source code</a>.</p>\n<p>We use a modified version of John Resig&#8217;s <a href=\"http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-micro-templating/\">basic templating script</a>. For more details, see <a href=\"http://dharmafly.com/tmpl/index.html\">my slides on client-side templating</a>, from a talk I recently gave at <a href=\"http://asyncjs.com\">Async</a>.</p>\n<h3>Educational</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/hine/2976359199/\" title=\"rocket by xmatt, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3055/2976359199_3cc917a957_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"160\" alt=\"rocket\"></a></p>\n<p>We ran out of time before we could finish integrating the Science Museum&#8217;s collections data with the Wikipedia data. After 24 hours of hacking, it was time to demo to the crowd.</p>\n<p>And we wound up with a prize for the hack most useful in education. Thanks guys!</p>\n<p>Take a look at the result: &#8220;<a href=\"http://dharmafly.com/revolutionaries/\">The Revolutionaries</a>&#8220;.<br />\n(The <a href=\"http://github.com/premasagar/revolutionaries\">source code is available on GitHub</a> to download or modify).</p>\n<h3>The people</h3>\n<p>The full list of people who contributed to the app were <a href=\"http://openobjects.blogspot.com\">Mia Ridge</a>, <a href=\"http://premasagar.com\">myself</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ianwootten.co.uk\">Ian Wooten</a>, <a href=\"http://tommorris.org/blog/\">Tom Morris</a>, <a href=\"http://yaili.com\">Inayaili de León</a>, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/goodonpaper\">Andy McMillan</a> and <a href=\"http://twitter.com/rboulton\">Richard Boulton</a>. With thanks to <a href=\"http://www.wait-till-i.com\">Christian</a>, as ever, for hands-on help with YQL.</p>\n<h3>The Hack Day</h3>\n<p>Science Hack Day was an exciting blend of scientific geekery and hackery, cross-pollination and fresh ideas.

Held at Google&#8217;s London <acronym title=\"headquarters\">HQ</acronym>, this was a two-day, action-packed programme for 15-18 year olds to build something better with government data on the web. And the results were truly impressive.</p>\n<p>Young people are sometimes written-off as being apathetic, or handed patronising websites and services to interact with. Here was their chance to show the kinds of services they really want and to demonstrate that, given access to the right kinds of data and a little support along the way, they are more than capable of building it themselves. <span id=\"more-1111\"></span></p>\n<p>In just two days, they created a plethora of new web apps: a mobile service to give real-time info on London buses (&#8220;<a href=\"http://rewiredstate.org/projects/tfhell\">TFHell</a>&#8220;), interactive maps with routes to school that avoid local crime hotspots (&#8220;<a href=\"http://stemount.co.uk/static/SchoolRoutr2.0.pdf\">SchoolRoutr</a>&#8221; and &#8220;Step Safe&#8221;), sexual health advice (&#8220;Blab to Betty&#8221;), a service matching new tech talent with employers (&#8220;<a href=\"http://twitter.com/workforpeanuts\">Will Work For Peanuts</a>&#8220;) and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/open-platform/blog/young-rewired-state\">many others</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/_anima_/3848641450/\" title=\"IMG_8620 (by anima)\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3484/3848641450_e3f501242f_m.jpg\" title=\"IMG_8620 (by anima)\" alt=\"IMG_8620 (by anima)\" width=\"240\" height=\"160\" /></a></p>\n<p>The team I assisted were a politically minded trio. <a href=\"http://www.freedomdreams.co.uk/blog\">Ben</a>, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/idde_ukl\">Joe</a> and <a href=\"http://identi.ca/binary0x5c\">Richard</a> came down from Manchester and built a website that grabs the <a href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/bills/\">latest bills</a> passing through parliament and attempts to show the emotional response to these bills from blogs around the web.

It was such a success that many of us who attended were invited to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_Office\">Cabinet Office</a> to explain just what the government should be doing with its web properties, and we were given suggestions on ways through what can sometimes seem like a maze of bureaucracies.</p>\n<p>Since then, no less than Tim Berners-Lee (the inventor of the Web) has been <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/jun/10/berners-lee-downing-street-web-open\">invited by the prime minister</a> to help <a href=\"http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/open_goverment_berners-lee_and_the_uk_to_show_obam.php\">open up government data</a>, to help bring transparency and to simply help those who want to solve problems get access to the data they need.

Hot on the heels of <a href=\"http://dharmafly.com/we-won-a-bric\">last week's UnLtdWorld award</a>, I was amazed to experience <a href=\"http://dharmafly.com/openfreecycle\">the web application</a> that I created with <a href=\"http://leitchy.com\">Tom Leitch</a> being awarded the top two prizes Yahoo's <a href=\"http://openhacklondon.pbworks.com\">OpenHackLondon</a>. And this, after <a href=\"http://dharmafly.com/hackhud\">winning a prize</a> with '<a href=\"http://dharmafly.com/projects/hackhud\">HackHUD</a>' at the previous Hack Day London, two years earlier (the famous one, when it <a href=\"http://www.vimeo.com/214490\">rained inside Alexandra Palace</a>).\n\nOpenHackLondon is an opportunity for web developers and programmers to get together, to collaborate and experiment with new ideas in technology. The focus is a 24-hour (overnight) hacking challenge, with a two-minute demo by each team, and prizes in several categories.\n\n<h3>OpenFreecycle</h3>\nOur entry was <a href=\"http://dharmafly.com/openfreecycle\">OpenFreecycle</a> - an itch that I'd been wanting to scratch for a couple of years. This was an attempt to make community sharing of free, unwanted items much more easy and accessible. Sort of like eBay, but for free. <span id=\"more-945\"></span>\n\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 510px\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/phploveme/3519083214/\" title=\"Yahoo Open Hack London 432 (by Jinho.Jung)\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3315/3519083214_59c13dff6e.jpg\" title=\"Yahoo Open Hack London 432 (by Jinho.Jung)\" alt=\"Yahoo Open Hack London 432 (by Jinho.Jung)\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Our two-minute presentation to the crowd</p></div>\n\nThere are around <a href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/search?query=freecycle\">10,000 local \"Freecycle\" mailing lists</a> (all of them are hosted on <a href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com\">Yahoo Groups</a>). They offer an extremely useful service: a way for people to offer or find unwanted items amongst their local community. Got a spare mattress? Put it on Freecycle. Need a chest of drawers? Find one on Freecycle.\n\n<h3>The Problem: Closed</h3>\nThe system, however, is far from ideal. Each group is initially private and closed. You need to request membership and await approval for each group before you can see what's available. Prospective browsing in neighbouring groups becomes a painful task.\n\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 510px\"><a title=\"10,000 Freecycle Groups\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dharmasphere/3532598667/\"><img title=\"10,000 Freecycle Groups\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2284/3532598667_b8826732d9.jpg\" alt=\"10,000 Freecycle Groups\" width=\"500\" height=\"309\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Over 10,000 Freecycle mailing lists on Yahoo Groups</p></div>\n\nAnd then there are the emails - hundreds in your inbox every day. And, because each group is just a plain and simple, private email list, there is no way to expose all that interesting content to other places on the web. That is, until now...\n\n<h3>The Solution: Open</h3>\nA simple, searchable, open system, with the option to subscribe to feeds for specific search terms in specific area (e.g. <a href=\"http://dharmafly.com/openfreecycle/feed/baby\">'baby' in Leeds</a>), the possibility to subscribe to alert notifications for specific items and the ability to integrate all this content around the web, for example with <a href=\"http://diveintogreasemonkey.org/install/what-is-greasemonkey.html\">Greasemonkey</a> in shopping sites, to inform you when an item is available for free in your local area:\n\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 510px\"><a title=\"OpenFreecycle on eBay, with Greasemonkey\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dharmasphere/3531532837/\"><img title=\"OpenFreecycle on eBay, with Greasemonkey\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2122/3531532837_5eb984b759.jpg\" alt=\"OpenFreecycle on eBay, with Greasemonkey\" width=\"500\" height=\"309\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A mockup for OpenFreecycle integration into eBay, via Greasemonkey</p></div>\n\nWhat we built was a rough proof-of-concept. It only handles the Leeds group - and very simplistically, at that - but it gives an idea of what is possible when you start to open up data.\n\n<em>(Of course, there are merits in selected aspects of the system being closed, or guarded - e.g. in protecting user's contact details, and the ability to identify potential exploiters, such as tradesmen scooping up everyone's free offerings. These need to be preserved, for the health of the community.)</em>\n\n<h3>How we did it</h3>\n<a title=\"OpenFreecycle\" href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/premasagar/openfreecycle\">Here are the slides</a> from our demo:\n<object width=\"500\" height=\"418\" data=\"http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?sessid=null&amp;pvt=0&amp;doc=slides-090510095852-phpapp01&amp;version_no=1242080051&amp;presentationId=1413363&amp;totalSlides=23&amp;startSlide=1&amp;inContest=0&amp;preview=no&amp;stitle=openfreecycle&amp;userName=premasagar&amp;has_form=null&amp;form_after_slide_number=null&amp;form_is_blocking=false&amp;hostedIn=slideshare&amp;useHttp=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?sessid=null&amp;pvt=0&amp;doc=slides-090510095852-phpapp01&amp;version_no=1242080051&amp;presentationId=1413363&amp;totalSlides=23&amp;startSlide=1&amp;inContest=0&amp;preview=no&amp;stitle=openfreecycle&amp;userName=premasagar&amp;has_form=null&amp;form_after_slide_number=null&amp;form_is_blocking=false&amp;hostedIn=slideshare&amp;useHttp=1\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /></object>\n\nWe used the <a href=\"http://developer.yahoo.com/mail/\">Yahoo Mail API</a> (via PHP) to log into a subscribing mailbox, then converted the emails to Atom feeds (with Perl), imported these into <a href=\"http://pipes.yahoo.com\">Yahoo Pipes</a> and performed geo-location, term-extraction and some other bits and bobs, drilled down into the resultant feeds with <a href=\"http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/\">YQL</a> and then presented the lot using the <a href=\"http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/staticmaps/\">Google Static Maps API</a> and a smattering of <a href=\"http://jquery.com\">jQuery</a>.
